ACME-QuoteDB

ACME::QuoteDB − API implements CRUD for a Collection of Quotes
(adages/proverbs/sayings/epigrams, etc)

This module provides an easy to use programmitic interface to a data‐
base (sqlite3 or mysql) of ’quotes’.  (any content really, that can fit
into our "defined format")

fortune (with a management interface, remote database connection sup‐
port, plus additional features and some not (yet) supported)
