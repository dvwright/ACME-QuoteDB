=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

By default, the quotes database used by this module installs in a system path,
which means you'll need to be root (sudo :) to load and modify it.

Alternativly, one can specify a location to a quotes database (file) to use.

Set the environmental variable:

$ENV{ACME_QUOTEDB_PATH} (untested on windows)

(this has to be set before trying a database load and also (everytime) before 
using this module, obviouly)
