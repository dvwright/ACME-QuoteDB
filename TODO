Unsuccessful stat on filename containing newline at /usr/share/perl5/ACME/QuoteDB/LoadDB.pm line 158.

3. should be able to pass a data stream to loader (as well as a file and dir, etc)

 83 my $load_db = LoadQuoteDBFromHTML->new({
 84                             file => $file,


       PERM_RW
         Desired permission for read/writable files. Defaults to 644.  See also "perm_rw" in
         MM_Unix.

       Â·   rules.Module-Build.noxs

           A debian/rules makefile for modules that use Module::Build, but don't have C/XS
           code.


3. fix 'untaint' file dir path for failing tests (i.e add '.' and for win32 add ':')
DBI connect('dbname=/home/ct/test/perl-5/quotes.db','',...) failed: unable to open database file at /home/ct/test/perl-5.10.0-thread/.cpan/build/ACME-QuoteDB-P_7VgA/blib/lib/ACME/QuoteDB/LoadDB.pm line 546
/home/ct/test/perl-5/quotes.db cannot be accessed  unable to open database file at t/01-load_quotes.t line 29
